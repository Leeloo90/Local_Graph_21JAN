Phased Development Roadmap Phased Development Roadmap  Phase 1: The "Bedrock" (Core Infrastructure) Goal: A running Electron app that can launch, initialize the database, and securely create/persist Projects. ..1.1 Environment & IPC: Set up Electron + Vite + TypeScript. Configure better-sqlite3 native build. Implement the Secure Bridge (Context Isolation). ..1.2 Database Engine: Implement schema_v5.sql (Doc B). Build the Migration Manager (auto-create tables). ..1.3 Project Dashboard: Build the "New Project" UI. Wire up project-create IPC. ..Checkpoint: Can we create a project, close the app, relaunch, and see it in the list? Phase 2: The "Ingest Engine" (Data Layer) Goal: Getting media into the system and analyzing it (Doc C & Doc L). ..2.1 FFprobe Worker: Bundle static binaries. Build the child process spawner. ..2.2 Import Logic: Implement media-import. Parse JSON metadata. Save to media_library. ..2.3 Proxy System: Build the background FFmpeg worker to generate proxies/waveforms. ..Checkpoint: Can we drop a 4K file in, see the metadata in DB, and find the generated Proxy in the cache folder? Phase 3: The "Narrative Canvas" (Physics Engine) Goal: Visualizing the data as a Topological Graph (Doc D & Doc G). ..3.1 Canvas UI: Infinite Pan/Zoom surface. Rendering Nodes from the DB. ..3.2 The Physics: Implement "Elastic Column" and "Snowplow" logic. ..3.3 Drag & Drop: "Ghost Box" snapping and Drop Zones. ..Checkpoint: Can we drag a media asset onto the canvas and have it "snap" into a valid Parent/Child structure? Phase 4: The "Temporal Floor" (Time Calculation) Goal: Deriving the Timeline from the Graph (Doc E & Doc F). ..4.1 Traversal Algorithm: The recursive math function (Start = Anchor + Drift). ..4.2 Timeline View: Rendering the linear strips based on the math. ..Checkpoint: If I delete a Node in the middle, does the Timeline "ripple" and close the gap? Phase 1: The "Bedrock" (Core Infrastructure) Phase 1: The "Bedrock" (Core Infrastructure) Objective: A stable Electron environment that initializes a local SQLite database and handles the creation and retrieval of Project entities.  1.1 Environment & IPC Architecture Goal: Initialize the repo and establish the secure communication lines. ..Task 1.1.1: Project Initialization ..Scaffold electron-vite-react template. ..Install Core Dependencies: better-sqlite3, uuid, fs-extra. ..Install Dev Dependencies: electron-builder (for native node module compilation). ..Task 1.1.2: Native Module Configuration ..Configure electron-builder to rebuild better-sqlite3 against the Electron ABI (Application Binary Interface). Crucial step to prevent "Module version mismatch" errors. ..Task 1.1.3: The Secure Bridge (Preload) ..Create src/preload/index.ts. ..Expose window.api using contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld. ..Define the Typed Interface for the API (ensure Type Safety between Main and Renderer). 1.2 Database Engine (The "Brain") Goal: Implement the Schema v5.0 and connection logic. ..Task 1.2.1: DB Initialization Script ..Create src/main/db/init.ts. ..Logic: Check if user_data/projects.db exists. If not, create it. ..Performance: Enable WAL Mode (Write-Ahead Logging) immediately for performance (PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;). ..Task 1.2.2: Schema Migration ..Implement the SQL execution of Doc B (Projects, Media Library, Nodes, Transaction Log). ..Wrap this in a transaction: The app should fail to launch if the schema cannot be fully applied. ..Task 1.2.3: Repository Layer ..Create src/main/db/repos/projects.ts. ..Implement functions: createProject(payload), getAllProjects(). 1.3 Project Dashboard (The UI) Goal: A React interface to test the backend logic. ..Task 1.3.1: IPC Handlers (Main Process).In src/main/index.ts, listen for ipcMain.handle('project:create') andipcMain.handle('project:get-all')...Task 1.3.2: Dashboard UI Components.Build ProjectList.tsx (Grid view of existing projects)..Build CreateProjectModal.tsx (Input for "Project Name", "Client Name")...Task 1.3.3: Wiring.Connect the React Form Submit $\to$ window.api.createProject $\to$ IPC $\to$SQLite Insert $\to$ Return UUID.Phase 1 Checklist: Definition of Done Before moving to Phase 2, we must check every box: .[ ] Launch Test: App starts without "NODE_MODULE_VERSION" errors (confirmsnative build works)..[ ] File System Test: A projects.db file exists in the OS Application Support folder..[ ] Schema Test: Opening projects.db with a tool (like DB Browser for SQLite) shows all5 tables (projects, canvases, media_library, nodes, transaction_log) with correctcolumns..[ ] Persistence Test:1..Create a project named "Alpha".2..Close the App completely (Quit).3..Relaunch.4.."Alpha" appears in the list automatically..[ ] Security Test: The Renderer console throws an error if we try to type require('fs')(confirms Context Isolation is active).
